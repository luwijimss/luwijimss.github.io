  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Louie James D. Baculio, and i am 17 Years old I am a student driven 
    by curiosity, creativity, and a strong interest in frontend design and web development.
    From a young age, I have been fascinated by how websites and digital interfaces are built 
    and how design and code come together to create engaging user experiences. What excites me 
    most about frontend design is the ability to turn ideas into interactive, visually appealing, 
    and functional digital products.
    As I continue my journey in technology, I focus on learning and improving my skills in frontend
    development, combining creativity with problem-solving and attention to detail. Every project I work
    on helps me better understand how design, responsiveness, and performance impact user experience. 
    I strive to build interfaces that are not only visually attractive but also accessible and user-friendly.
    Outside of academics, I enjoy resting, reading to expand my knowledge, and spending time with the people who 
    motivate me. I am proud to be recognized for my academic efforts and remain passionate about frontend design, 
    where creativity and technology come together to bring ideas to life.
